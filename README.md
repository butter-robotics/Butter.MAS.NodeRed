<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project extends the basic node-red node types with new nodes that encapsulate Butter Robotics operations and api calls.
This can prove very useful when building IoT flows and orchestration using Node-Red, and needing to use Butter as well.


### Built With

* [Butter Javascript API](https://github.com/butter-robotics/Butter.MAS.JavascriptAPI)
* [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.


### Prerequisites

* Node-Red
  (Please refer to this [documentation](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/windows) for easy installation on Windows).


### Installation

* Install the package.
  ```sh
  npm install @butter-robotics/mas-node-red-api@latest -g
  ```
* Restart Node-Red and validate that the new nodes exist in your node pallette.

## Usage

Once you have completed the prerequisites, the new nodes should appear in all their glory in the node pallette:
